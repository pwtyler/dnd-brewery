### Find Familiar[^ffdndb]
As an action, if your familiar is within 100', you can “enter” your familiar’s senses per the spell description. Dropping your connection to your familiar is a free action, and you do not need to use your action each round to maintian use of your familiar's senses. If your familiar is more than 1000' away from you, the connection is lost.[^ff1]

You can choose to roll initiative for your familiar, or place its turn immediately after your own in the turn order.

### Wizard[^wizarddndb]
#### Conjuration Wizard
##### Minor Conjuration
  * A conjured lantern, candle, or torch sheds light as if it were a real, illuminating object, but at half the distance of the "real" item.
  * A conjured food or liquid can be consumed, but does not offer any nutritious (or intoxicating) effects. The food is particularly bland. Wine is a tinge sour.
